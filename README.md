#About

We created Milk to illustrate the concept of functional privacy. Milk is
designed to limit cross-site tracking without reducing functionality for the
user. The general idea is to restrict, or bind, cookies to the first-party site
from which they were created rather than disabling cookies entirely. 

Send questions and comments to milkhelp@cs.umass.edu.


#Algorithm Overview

Milk implements cookie binding by intercepting cookies both before they are
stored and before they are sent. Imagine this simplified example using a single
first-party site. When the user visits example.com, the server responds with an
HTTP Set-Cookie header instructing the browser to store a cookie. Milk will
rewrite the cookie before it is stored, appending the key "example.com!!!" to
the cookieâ€™s name. For subsequent web requests to example.com, Milk will rewrite
the HTTP Cookie header to both remove the domain-specific keys and ensure that
only cookies with the appropriate key are sent back to the server. 

See http://forensics.umass.edu/milk.php for more information.
